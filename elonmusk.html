            <h1>Introduction of Elon Musk</h1>
            
            <p class="qoute">"Patience is a virtue, and I'm learning patience. It's a tough lesson." - Elon Musk</p>
            <p>Elon was born in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa. His mother was a model and dietician from Canada, and his father a South African-born electromechanical engineer.</p>
            <p>When he was ten years old he deveoped an interest in computing. By the age of twelf, he taught himself computer programming. He created a game called Blastar and sold it to a magazine called 'PC and Office Technology' for approximately US$500.</p>
            <p>He moved to Canada just before his 18th birthday, after obtaining Canadian citizenship through his mother. At 19, he was accepted into Queen's University for undergraduate study. After spending two years at Queen's University, he transferred to
              the University of Pennsylvania where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.</p>
            <p>He moved to California to begin a PhD in applied physics and materials science at Stanford University, but left the program after two days to pursue his entrepreneurial aspirations in the areas of the Internet, renewable energy and outer space.</p>
      
            
            <h1 id="c">Career</h1>
            <h3>1.Zip2</h3>
            <h4>Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2">Zip2 </a></h4>
            <p class="qoute">"I say something, and then it usually happens. Maybe not on schedule, but it usually happens." - Elon Musk</p>
            <p>Elon and his brother started Zip2 with US$28,000 of their father's money. The company developed and marketed an Internet "city guide" for the newspaper publishing industry. They obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune
              and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch. Elon wanted to be CEO but the board members would not allow it. Compaq bought Zip2 for US$307 million and US$34 million in stock options in 1999. Elon received
              7% from the sale.</p>
      
            <h3>2.X.com and PayPal</h3>
            <h4>Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2">X.com and PayPal </a></h4>
            <p class="qoute">"Any product that needs a manual to work is broken." - Elon Musk</p>
            <p>Elon co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2. One year later, the company merged with Confinity, which had a money transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused
              on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. Elon was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership. In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for
              US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165 million.</p>
      
            <h3>3.SpaceX</h3>
            <h4>Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2">SpaceX</a></h4>
            <p class="qoute">"I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact." - Elon Musk</p>
            <p>In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis", a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops. Elon travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college),
              to buy refurbished ICBMs that could send the envisioned payloads into space. They met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras, however, Elon was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers, and
              the group returned to the USA empty-handed. In 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group met again with Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for US$8
              million. This was seen by Elon as too expensive. He consequently stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed. He calculated that the
              raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten
              and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin. Elon ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization.</p>
      
            <p>SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology. The company's first two launch vehicles are the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets, a ode to Star Wars, and its first spacecraft the Dragon,
              in reference to 'Puff the Magic Dragon'. In seven years, they designed the family of Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon multipurpose spacecraft. In 2008, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded liquid-fueled vehicle to put
              a satellite into Earth orbit. On May 25, 2012, the SpaceX Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the International Space Station.</p>
            <p>In 2006, SpaceX was awarded a contract from NASA to continue the development and test of the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the International Space Station, followed by a US$1.6 billion NASA Commercial
              Resupply Services program contract on December 23, 2008, for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the Space Station, replacing the US Space Shuttle after it retired in 2011. Astronaut transport to the ISS is currently handled
              solely by the Soyuz, but SpaceX is one of two companies awarded a contract by NASA as part of the Commercial Crew Development program, which is intended to develop a US astronaut transport capability by 2018. On 22 December 2015, SpaceX successfully
              landed the first stage of its Falcon rocket back at the launch pad. This was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space.
              This first stage recovery was replicated several times in 2016 by landing on an Autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean based recovery platform. In late 2016 SpaceX intends to launch its Falcon Heavy rocket, which will be the most powerful operational
              rocket in the world.</p>
            <p>SpaceX is both the largest private producer of rocket motors in the world, and holder of the record for highest thrust-to-weight ratio for any known rocket motor. SpaceX has produced more than 100 operational Merlin 1D engines, currently the world's
              most powerful motor for its weight. The relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each Merlin 1D motor to vertically lift the weight of 40 average family cars. In combination, the 9 Merlin engines in the Falcon 9 first stage produces anywhere
              from 5.8 to 6.7 MN (1.3 to 1.5 million pounds) of thrust, depending on altitude.</p>
            <p>Elon was influenced by Isaac Asimov's Foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in expanding—if not preserving—the consciousness of human life. Elon said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the
              survival of the human species.</p>
            <p class="qoute">"An asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us, and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw: an engineered virus, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, catastrophic global warming or some as-yet-unknown technology could spell the end of us.
              Humankind evolved over millions of years, but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves. Sooner or later, we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct."</p>
      
            <p>Elon's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10. In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10–20 years. In Ashlee Vance's biography, he stated that he wants to establish a Mars colony by
              2040, with a population of 80,000. Musk stated that, since Mars' atmosphere lacks oxygen, all transportation would have to be electric. Space X intends to launch a Dragon spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy in 2018 to soft-land on Mars - this is intended
              to be the first of a regular cargo mission supply-run to Mars building up to later crewed flights. Elon stated in June 2016 that the first unmanned flight of the larger Mars Colonial Transporter spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet
              in 2022, to be followed by the first manned MCT Mars flight departing in 2024. In September 2016, Musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize Mars. By 2016, Musk's private trust holds 54% of SpaceX stock, equivalent to 78% of voting
              shares.

            <h3>4.Tesla Motors</h3>
            <h4>Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2">Tesla Motors </a></h4>
            <p class="qoute">"When Henry Ford made cheap, reliable cars people said, 'Nah, what's wrong with a horse?' That was a huge bet he made, and it worked." - Elon Musk</p>
            <p>Tesla Motors was incorporated in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.</p>
            <p>Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon's involvement. Elon led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman. He took an active role within the company
              and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.</p>
            <p>Following the financial crisis in 2008, he assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect, positions he still holds today. Tesla Motors first built an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster in 2008, with sales of about 2,500 vehicles
              to 31 countries. They began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan on June 22, 2012. They unveiled their third product, the Model X, aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on February 9, 2012. The Model X launch was however delayed until September
              2015. In addition to its own cars, Tesla sells electric powertrain systems to Daimler for the Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive and Mercedes A Class and to Toyota for the RAV4 EV. Elon was able to bring in both companies as long-term investors
              in Tesla
            </p>
            <p>Elon has favored building a sub-US$30,000 subcompact Tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products in-house.
              Several mainstream publications have compared him with Henry Ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains.</p>
            <p>As of 2014, Musk's annual salary is one dollar. And, similar to Steve Jobs and others, the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performance-based bonuses</p>
      
            <h3>5.SolarCity</h3>
            <h4>Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2">SolarCity</a></h4>
            <p class="qoute">"We're running the most dangerous experiment in history right now, which is to see how much carbon dioxide the atmosphere... can handle before there is an environmental catastrophe." - Elon Musk</p>
            <p>Elon provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which was then co-founded in 2006 by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive. Elon remains the largest shareholder. SolarCity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems
              in the United States.</p>
            <p>The underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla is to help combat global warming. In 2012, Elon announced that SolarCity and Tesla Motors are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on
              the power grid, with the program going live in 2013.</p>
            <p>On June 17, 2014, Elon committed to building in Buffalo, New York, a SolarCity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar
              panel production plants in the world, and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent years.</p>
      
            <h3>6.Hyperloop</h3>
            <h4>Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2">Hyperloop </a></h4>
            <p class="qoute">"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor." - Elon Musk</p>
            <p>On August 12, 2013, Elon unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. The mechanism for
              releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
            <p>A dozen engineers from Tesla Motors and SpaceX worked for nine months, establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system. An early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the
              Tesla and SpaceX blogs. Elon's proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances. The alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce
              aerodynamic drag, which it is theorized would allow for high-speed travel with relatively low power, with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag. The alpha design document estimated the total cost
              of an LA-to-SF Hyperloop system at US$6 billion, but this amount is speculative.</p>
      
            <h3>7.OpenAI</h3>
            <h4>Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2">OpenAI </a></h4>
            <p class="qoute">"Some people don't like change, but you need to embrace change if the alternative is disaster." - Elon Musk</p>
            <p>In December 2015, Elon Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence research company. OpenAI aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity.</p>
            <p>By making AI available to everyone, OpenAI wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as governments which may use AI to gain power and even oppress their citizenry.
